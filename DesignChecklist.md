## Design Checklist

This is a short checklist for designers delivering visual designs or wireframes for responsive sites.

**1. Are all the elements present for all screen sizes?**  
  All elements should be present no matter the screen size. The elements can be slightly altered, but all users deserve to the same content, no matter how they are viewing our website.

**2. Is the HTML order the same for all screen sizes?**  
  We cannot re-arrange source order for HTML between screen sizes. This means that content cannot "break out of their boxes".  

**3. Are all the image elements necessary for this page?**  
  The more image elements you can remove, the faster the load time for the web page.
We should try and use CSS as much as possible for styling.  

**4. Are any new components, typography, ect. absolutely necessary?**  
  We should try and re-use previous styles and components as much as possible, unless we have a completely new functionality.
